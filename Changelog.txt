Version 1.0.0 - November 20, 2015
---------------------------------

Initial release, featuring orbital ion cannons that can pretty much obliterate anything you might come across.


Version 1.0.1 - November 20, 2015
---------------------------------

"Select Target" no longer plays when all ion cannons are on cooldown.
Added damage amount for each ion cannon blast to config.lua.


Version 1.0.2 - November 22, 2015
---------------------------------

Ion Cannons can now be crafted in vanilla Assembling Machine 3s, if there are no other mods installed which enable higher tiers of assembling machines.


Version 1.0.3 - November 22, 2015
---------------------------------

Fixed a bug in multiplayer mode.


Version 1.0.4 - November 23, 2015
---------------------------------

Added a third GUI state; now, clicking the main Ion Cannon button cycles through Closed, Open (Full), and Open (Compact).
This is helpful if you happen to have lots of ion cannons in orbit and would rather not have the GUI take up half of your screen!


Version 1.0.5 - December 2, 2015
---------------------------------

Added an option in config.lua to enable/disable the klaxon sound that plays whenever an ion cannon target is designated.
Added an option in config.lua to adjust ion cannons' heatup time, i.e. the time between target designation and ion cannon blast impact.
Slightly increased the default value of the ion cannon blast radius. (You can of course still change it in config.lua if you want.)
Adjusted minimum base version requirement to >=0.12.17, due to graphical oddities present in lower versions.
